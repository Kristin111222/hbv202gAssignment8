# University Library System
## The goal of this assignment is to implement the backend of a simplified university library system which would handle the lending process of books, extend lending for faculty members and more. The backend will then be used by classes implementing authenication and a user interface.
## Java and Visual Studio code app are used in this assignment




# Key Features
- Users can borrow books for an automatically set of duration (30 days)
- Only faculty members can extend the lending duration of a book
- Each book has at least one author
- The LibrarySystem class stores books and provides the necesssary features for finding, borrowing, extending, and returning books.

# Steps to Implement



4. Boilerplate Code:
- Getters and Setters
- Constructors
- Methods from UML
- For following methods, leave the bodies empty or with simple returns
 - find()
 - borrow()
 - extend()
 - returnBook()

5. Exeption
- Some methods throw exceptions (when a book or user does not exist)
- Methods that throw exceptions should be marked with throws.
6. Aggregation
- Use List<Type> for fields that handle collection of objects
7. Library Operations
- Lending Due Date: IN the constructor for Lending, set the due date to 30 days from the current date
8. Observer (add an Observer class)


11. Design patterns (Observer)
12. Refactor
